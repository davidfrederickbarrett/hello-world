# hello-world
just another repository
I have actually retired from a life of, at first, Computer and electronic Design Engineer and Later: Systems Analyst and Software Developer. I am enjoying retirement which is utterly different from my working life - pruning Olive trees, Harvesting Olives, Building using actual cement. Although exceptionally happy, I long to get back into some sort of software developement, apart from the odd software jobs in which I am currently engaged. 

I have no changes to commit yet.
